# iOSCalculatorApp
In this assignment you will build a simple iOS application. You will get familiar with
common iOS components and how to interact with them. You will build a single window
simple calculator application.

Part 1 (80 Points)
The interface should be created to match the user interface (UI) presented in Figure 1.
To build the UI, please follow the following tasks:
1. Create a new project called “InClass02a”
2. This is a simple calculator for basic operations ( +,-,x, and /) for two inputs. Each
button will perform the logic of the corresponding operation and display the result in
the Result textView. Note that:
a. Add operation: Result = Number1 + Number 2
b. Subtract operation: Result = Number1 - Number 2
c. Multiply operation: Result = Number1 * Number 2
d. Divide operation: Result = Number1 / Number 2
e. Clear All should clear all the input fields and resets the Result to 0.00
3. Your code should check for special cases such as when there are no numbers entered, invalid numbers and divide by zero. In such special cases display a Toast
message indicating the error.
4. The selected operation is executed when the corresponding operation’s button is
clicked.
5. Your code should check for special cases such as when there are no numbers
entered or divide by zero. In such special cases display an alert dialog indicating to
the user that an error has occurred.
6. Use auto layout to configure the layout such that it matches Figure 1(a) in portrait and
Figure 2(b) in landscape.

Part 2 (20 Points)
The interface should be created to match the user interface (UI) presented in Figure 2.
To build the UI, please follow the following tasks:
1. Create a new project called “InClass02b”
2. This is a simple calculator for basic operations ( +,-,x, and /) for two inputs. Each
button will perform the logic of the corresponding operation and display the result in
the Result textView. Note that:
a. Add operation: Result = Number1 + Number 2
b. Subtract operation: Result = Number1 - Number 2
c. Multiply operation: Result = Number1 * Number 2
d. Divide operation: Result = Number1 / Number 2
3. The app uses the segmented control UI component to display the different operation
options.
4. Your code should check for special cases such as when there are no numbers
entered, invalid numbers and divide by zero. In such special cases display a Toast
message indicating the error.
5. ClearAll: clear all the input fields and resets the Result to 0.00
6. The selected operation is executed when the “Perform Operation” button is clicked.
7. Your code should check for special cases such as when there are no numbers
entered or divide by zero. In such special cases display an alert dialog indicating to
the user that an error has occurred.
8. Use auto layout to configure the layout such that it matches Figure 2(a) in portrait and
Figure 2(b) in landscape.
